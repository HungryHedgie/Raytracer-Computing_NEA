# Raytracer - Computing NEA
The code for a simple 2D antialiasing function, along with pseudocode for a few key functions.

A high res 2D image is taken as the input and a lower res 2D image is produced.

Random sampling anti-aliasing is used to smooth edges of the produced image using different techniques.
